# Congkak-Game

## What is Congkak?
Congkak is a traditional board game that can be found in Southeast Asia. 

The name varies from countries to countries. For example, it's called "Congkak" in Malaysia and Brunei, "Jogklak" in Indonesia and "Sungka" in Philippines.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asian_mancala)

You can refer to the [rules here](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Congkak).

## Why I made this?
I had the urge to play this game one day, but I don't have the board and marbles because I'm far away from home.

Then I found this YouTube video: [Web Development Tutorial - JavaScript, HTML, CSS - Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://youtu.be/jaVNP3nIAv0) and got simulated to make one so that I can play it without the physical object.

## Differences compared to the Physical Congkak
- Usually it's possible to pick who goes first, but for simplicity purposes, Player 1 (at the bottom) always goes first.
- Numbers are used to represent the number of marbles in each houses and the storage instead of marbles (illustration).
  - I will change to marbles after I learn how to draw using JavaScript.
- At the moment, the animation for the moment of marbles in each turn is ommitted.
  - because of this, it might be hard to understand what's going on in each turn for those who are new to the game.
  (with the board and marbles, players will be moving the marbles one at a time)
  - similar to the marble's case, I will try to animate the movement so that it's easier to understand and more entertaining (I hope).
